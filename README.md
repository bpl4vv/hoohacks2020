# Hoohacks 2020 - The Discord Bot Server

The purpose of this bot was to streamline office hour queues in Discord. Recently, schools nationwide and nationally have moved to online learning in response to the global pandemic of COVID-19. While there are an abundant amount of resources online, our recent experiences in office hours has been lacking.

As a TA, using breakout rooms in Zoom can often be difficult to manage, and in the context of some classes there can be 50+ people seeking help and 7 TAs to help. How are these handles student efficiently, on at a time?

Many classes at UVA have moved to discord - Software Development Methods, Algorithms, Human Computer Interaction, and Operating Systems to name a few. Using Queue Bot and its respective commands allows students and TAs in a Discord server to easily connect, dissolving a lot of the overhead and logistical problems with having Office Hours online.
